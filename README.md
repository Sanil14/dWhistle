## **Inspiration** :mechanical_arm:
- Providing confidentiality . A whistleblowing platform provides a confidential service that allows employees to draw attention to any issues that they feel are inappropriate for the workplace.
- We built a platform on the ethereum blockchain, seeking to create a decentralised platform. The user's " POSTS " will virtually remain anonymous to anybody reading the information.

## **What it does** :gear:
- DWHISTLE is a decentralised application that can operate autonomously, through the use of smart contracts, that runs on a decentralized computing, blockchain system (ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN) .
- It's a platform where anyone can report (" POST ") information or activity within a private, public, or government organisation that's deemed illegal, immoral, illicit, unsafe, fraud, or misuse of taxpayer funds.

## **How we built it**

## **Challenges we ran into**

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

## **What we learned**

## **What's next for dWhistle :hourglass:**
- A custom blockchain network / crypto currency ðŸª™
