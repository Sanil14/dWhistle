## **Inspiration**

## **What it does**
**- DWHISTLE is a decentralised application built on the Web 3.0 platform.**
**It's a platform where anyone can report information or activity within a private, public, or government organisation that's deemed illegal, immoral, illicit, unsafe, fraud, or misuse of taxpayer funds.**

## **How we built it**

## **Challenges we ran into**

## **Accomplishments that we're proud of**

## **What we learned**
